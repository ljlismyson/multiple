"""Public API for the ``model`` package.

Each subtask folder (``model/<task>/``) is a self-contained sub-package: its
``__init__.py`` imports its concrete model files so their ``@register_model``
decorators populate the shared registry. To use a subtask's models, import
``build_model`` from that subtask, e.g.::

    from model.coherent_noise_attenuation import build_model

This top-level package only exposes the registry primitives plus the
identity-forward ``placeholder`` so generic tooling can run without picking a
subtask. Loading multiple subtasks in the same Python process is not supported
because they register the same model names (``unet``, ``res_unet``, ...).
